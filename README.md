# Machine Learning - Image Classification 
Project of the Module 3: 'Machine Learning for Computer Vision' of the Master's degree in Computer Vision at Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona (UAB)

## Summary
This repository contains the code and documentation for a comprehensive study on image classification conducted as part of a master's degree project. The project explores a variety of methods and techniques for image classification, ranging from traditional approaches like the visual bag of words method to modern machine learning techniques such as MLP end-to-end classifiers with spatial pyramids. It investigates the performance of different feature extraction methods, including KAZE, SIFT, and Dense SIFT, and evaluates their impact on classification accuracy using KNN's and SVM. Additionally, the project includes the development of a neural network from scratch, incorporating weight pruning for further optimization. Techniques such as data augmentation and hyperparameter optimization with Optuna are also employed. The findings suggest that employing simple models with the addition or removal of layers, alongside state-of-the-art methods, can lead to improved accuracy while maintaining manageable model complexity.

## Weekly Submits
### Week 1:
We focused on enhancing the Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) code for our project by implementing several improvements and conducting thorough evaluations. Here's a summary of the tasks accomplished:
- Testing Different Amounts of Local Features
- Utilizing Dense SIFT Instead of Detected Keypoints
- Testing Different Codebook Sizes (k)
- Exploring Different Values of k for k-NN Classifier 
- Experimenting with Different Distance Metrics in k-NN Classifier
- Dimensionality Reduction Exploration
- Cross-Validation of All Implemented Techniques
